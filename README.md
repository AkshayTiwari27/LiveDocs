### ✨ Features & Technical Implementation

| 🧩 Feature | ⚙️ Technical Implementation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Real-Time Collaborative Editing** | Leverages **Liveblocks** for real-time data synchronization of editor state between multiple users, including cursor presence and text changes. The `CollaborativeRoom` component manages the Liveblocks `RoomProvider` and `ClientSideSuspense` for a smooth collaborative session. The `Editor` component integrates `LiveblocksPlugin` for real-time features, along with `FloatingComposer` and `FloatingThreads` for interactive UI elements. |
| **Rich-Text Editor & Formatting** | Implements a powerful and extensible text editor using the **Lexical editor framework**. Features a comprehensive toolbar with formatting options like headings, bold, italics, underline, strikethrough, and alignment, managed by `ToolbarPlugin`. A `FloatingToolbarPlugin` provides contextual editing options. |
| **AI-Powered Content Generation** | Integrates **Google Generative AI** (Gemini 1.5 Flash) to assist users with content creation. Users can input a prompt via the `AIModal` component, which sends a request to a Next.js API route (`/api/gemini`) that then calls the `getAIResponse` server action to interact with the AI model and insert the generated text directly into the editor. |
| **User Authentication & Management** | Integrates **Clerk** for secure user authentication, including sign-up and sign-in flows (`app/(auth)/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx`, `app/(auth)/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx`). Middleware (`middleware.ts`) is used to protect routes and manage user sessions, ensuring secure access to documents. User data from Clerk is fetched and managed via `lib/actions/user.actions.ts`. |
| **Document CRUD & Management** | Provides full Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality for documents. Users can create new documents (`AddDocumentBtn.tsx`), view a list of their documents on the home page (`app/(root)/page.tsx`), update titles (`CollaborativeRoom.tsx`), and delete documents they own (`DeleteModal.tsx`), all handled via Next.js Server Actions in `lib/actions/room.actions.ts`. |
| **Sharing, Permissions & Access Control** | Users can share documents via email and assign roles ("editor" or "viewer") to collaborators to manage permissions. This is implemented through the `ShareModal` component and the `updateDocumentAccess` server action. The `UserTypeSelector` and `Collaborator` components facilitate this functionality. |
| **Real-time Commenting System** | A complete commenting system with real-time updates and threaded conversations, powered by Liveblocks' `useThreads` and `Composer` components, implemented in `Comments.tsx`. |
| **Notifications & User Presence**| In-app notifications for document shares and mentions are handled via **Liveblocks Inbox** (`Notifications.tsx`). The UI displays active collaborators in a document, showing their avatars in real-time using the `ActiveCollaborators` component. |
| **Modern, Responsive Frontend** | Built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, styled with **Tailwind CSS** (`tailwind.config.ts`, `app/globals.css`), and utilizing **Shadcn UI** components (`components/ui/`) for a responsive, modern, and consistent component library. |
| **Error Monitoring & Reliability** | Integrates **Sentry** for comprehensive error tracking and performance monitoring on both the client (`sentry.client.config.ts`) and server (`sentry.server.config.ts`, `sentry.edge.config.ts`), ensuring a stable and reliable user experience across the application. Global error handling is configured in `app/global-error.tsx`. |

       width="850" />
  <br/>
  <em>A high-level overview of the LiveDocs architecture, showing the client-server interaction, component structure, and integration with external services.</em>
</p>

LiveDocs is built on a modern, serverless architecture optimized for performance, scalability, and developer experience. The system is logically structured to separate concerns, from the user interface to the real-time backend services.

```

### Architectural Breakdown

1.  **Client-Side (Frontend)**
    The frontend is a dynamic and responsive single-page application built with **Next.js** and **React**, utilizing the **App Router** paradigm.

      * **UI Components**: The interface is constructed with a combination of custom components and **Shadcn UI**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a consistent and modern aesthetic.
      * **Routing**: Employs a file-based routing system with route groups for clear separation of `(auth)` and `(root)` application sections, managed by `middleware.ts`.

2.  **Server-Side (Backend)**
    The backend leverages a serverless approach with **Next.js Server Actions** and **API Routes**, creating a seamless and efficient integration between the client and server.

      * **Server Actions**: Core business logic, such as document creation, updates, sharing, user fetching, and AI content generation, is encapsulated in Server Actions within `lib/actions/`. This allows for direct, secure client-server communication without the overhead of traditional REST APIs.
      * **API Routes**: Dedicated API routes handle specific functionalities like Liveblocks authentication (`app/api/liveblocks-auth/route.ts`) and AI interaction (`app/api/gemini/route.ts`).
      * **Authentication & Authorization**: User authentication is powered by **Clerk**. A robust middleware (`middleware.ts`) protects application routes and manages user sessions, ensuring secure document access.

3.  **Real-time Collaboration & Data Layer**
    The real-time and data layers are managed by **Liveblocks**, which serves as the backend for collaborative features.

      * **Liveblocks**: Handles all real-time data synchronization, including document content, user presence, and comments. The authentication for Liveblocks is managed through a dedicated API route (`app/api/liveblocks-auth/route.ts`). Document creation, retrieval, and updates interact directly with the Liveblocks API via `lib/actions/room.actions.ts` and `lib/liveblocks.ts`.
      * **Data Persistence**: Liveblocks manages the storage and persistence of document data, ensuring that all collaborative changes are saved reliably.

4.  **External Services**
    LiveDocs integrates with external services to enhance its functionality.

      * **Sentry**: Used for comprehensive error tracking and performance monitoring on both the client and server, ensuring a high-quality user experience. Sentry configuration is split between client-side (`sentry.client.config.ts`), server-side (`sentry.server.config.ts`), and edge environments (`sentry.edge.config.ts`), with dynamic import through `instrumentation.ts`.
